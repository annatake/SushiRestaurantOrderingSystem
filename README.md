# SushiRestaurantOrderingSystem

An ordering system for a sushi restaurant.

## Background
I work at a family run sushi restaurant with a pretty extensive menu, and thought it would be a fun to create an "ordering system" that enables the user to add items to their To-Go Order, allow slight customizations (eg. brown rice, extra noodles), and finally calculate the total price and estimated time it will be ready for pick-up.
